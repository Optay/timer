# The Timer Thing
The Timer Thing is an HTML5 time tracker. It was written as a little experimental test project. It has been reorganized a few times, and could use another pass or three.

The Timer is essentially a timer. Time is tracked in blocks. A block has a start time and an end time. Blocks are stored in days. A day has a date. And days are stored in tasks. A task represents a project for which you want to track time. Data is stored in the browser's local storage.
